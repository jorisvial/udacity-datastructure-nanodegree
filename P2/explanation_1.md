# Data structure

This problem did not require any specific data stucture. It behaves like a binary search tree but it's only an implicit concept here and it's not actually in memory.

# Complexity

It's a simple binary search. Nothing special going one. Our time complexity is O(logn) and our space complexity is O(1).
