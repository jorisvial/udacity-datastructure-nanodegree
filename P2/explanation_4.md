# Data structure

This problem did not require any specific data stucture.

# Complexity

Since the input only contains 3 differents values (here 0, 1 and 2), we can sort the array in a single pass by simply flipping values to their correct position.
This gives us a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as we are doing the swap inplace.
